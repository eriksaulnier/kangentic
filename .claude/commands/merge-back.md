# Merge Back

Merge the current worktree branch back into the source branch via rebase and direct push.

## Pre-flight Checks

1. Verify the current working directory is inside a Kangentic worktree (path contains `.kangentic/worktrees/`). If not, warn the user and stop.
2. Get the current branch name: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
3. Determine the project root by walking up from the worktree path — the project root is two directories above `.kangentic/worktrees/<slug>/` (i.e., strip `.kangentic/worktrees/<slug>` from the worktree path).
4. Read the source branch from `<projectRoot>/.kangentic/config.json` — look for `git.defaultBaseBranch`. If the file doesn't exist or the field is missing, default to `main`.
5. Run `git status --porcelain` to check for uncommitted changes.

Report the branch name, source branch, and working tree status before proceeding.

## Step 1 — Commit Changes

If there are uncommitted changes (non-empty `git status --porcelain` output):

1. Show the user `git status` and `git diff --stat` for a summary of changes.
2. Ask the user what they'd like to do:
   - Provide a commit message
   - Let you generate a commit message from the diff
   - Skip (leave changes uncommitted — warn this will prevent rebase)
3. If committing: `git add -A` then `git commit -m "<message>"`

If the working tree is clean, skip to Step 2.

## Step 2 — Fetch Latest Source Branch

Run: `git fetch origin <sourceBranch>`

Report if the fetch succeeded or if there were errors (e.g., no remote, authentication failure).

## Step 3 — Rebase onto Source Branch

Run: `git rebase origin/<sourceBranch>`

**If the rebase succeeds** — proceed to Step 4.

**If conflicts occur:**

1. Show the conflicting files using `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`
2. Ask the user which approach they prefer:
   - **Resolve conflicts** — open each conflicting file, edit the conflict markers, then `git add <file>` and `git rebase --continue`
   - **Abort and merge instead** — `git rebase --abort` then `git merge origin/<sourceBranch>` (creates a merge commit)
   - **Abort entirely** — `git rebase --abort` and stop the merge-back process
3. If resolving conflicts: read each conflicting file, use `Edit` to resolve the conflict markers, stage the file, and continue the rebase. Repeat until all conflicts are resolved.

## Step 4 — Push to Source Branch

Run: `git push origin HEAD:<sourceBranch>`

This pushes the rebased commits directly to the remote source branch. After a successful rebase, this is guaranteed to be a fast-forward push.

**If the push fails** (e.g., someone else pushed in the meantime):

1. Report the error clearly.
2. Suggest re-running `/merge-back` to fetch the latest and rebase again.
3. Stop — do not force-push.

## Step 5 — Update Local Source Branch Reference

Run: `git fetch origin <sourceBranch>:<sourceBranch>`

This fast-forwards the local source branch ref to match the remote, keeping the main worktree's local branch in sync without needing to switch directories.

If this fails (e.g., the local branch is checked out in another worktree), report the warning but do not treat it as a fatal error — the remote is already updated.

## Step 6 — Report

Summarize:
- Branch name that was merged
- Source branch that received the changes
- Number of commits landed (from `git log origin/<sourceBranch>@{1}..origin/<sourceBranch> --oneline` or similar)
- Remind the user they can clean up the worktree by moving the task to Done on the board (which triggers `cleanup_worktree`) or manually

## Allowed Tools

Use `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Bash` (for `git` commands only), `Edit` (for conflict resolution), and `AskUserQuestion`. Do not use `Write`. Always run commands from the worktree directory — no chained commands (`&&`, `||`, `|`, `;`).
