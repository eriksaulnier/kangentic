 *
 * This is the single write-time chokepoint for the invariant, so IPC, MCP, the
 * mobile bridge, and every other caller inherit it rather than each remembering
 * the rule. It is load-bearing beyond tidiness:
 * `lockAdvancedOverridesOnFirstSpawn` fires on `run_mode === 'agent_override'`,
 * so a profile task that also claimed override mode would get all four fields
 * frozen to its first column's values and its ladder would silently flatten.
 *
 * `requested` must contain only the fields the caller explicitly provided
 * (`undefined` = untouched). Reading intent from `requested` rather than from the
 * merged `next` is what makes "pin a model on a task that currently rides a
 * profile" do the obvious thing - switch it to Custom - instead of the merged
 * view seeing a non-null profile_id and throwing the new pin away.
 *
 * Precedence, highest first:
 *   1. A profile assignment wins outright: it is the more specific intent, and
 *      it is how the UI expresses "switch this task off its Custom pins onto a
 *      ladder". It clears the pins AND forces `'column_settings'`.
 *   2. Pinning any of the four, or asking for `'agent_override'` explicitly,
 *      means override mode and detaches from the profile. The explicit mode
 *      matters on its own: "Agent Override with everything left on inherit"
 *      pins nothing, and is exactly the state the derived-mode approach lost.
 *   3. Asking for `'column_settings'` clears the pins, mirroring what the
 *      dialog's Column Settings card does locally.
 * A write touching none of them leaves all three alone.
