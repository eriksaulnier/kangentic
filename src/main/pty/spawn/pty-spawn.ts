/**
 * Build the environment block for `pty.spawn`.
 *
 * Strips the parent Claude Code session's detection/identity markers. When
 * Kangentic is launched from inside a Claude Code session (the team dogfoods
 * this way, and `/preview` is often started from an agent), Claude Code exports
 * these into the environment and they would otherwise leak into every spawned
 * agent PTY:
 *   - `CLAUDECODE`               - "you are inside Claude Code" (made the child refuse to start)
 *   - `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`   - the parent's entry point (e.g. `cli`)
 *   - `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION`- "you are a nested session" (Claude Code v2.1.172+)
 *   - `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`   - the PARENT's session UUID
 *   - `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECPATH`     - the parent's claude binary
 *
 * A child that inherits the parent's session identity does not persist its own
 * transcript under the `--session-id <uuid>` Kangentic assigns it, so a later
 * `claude --resume <uuid>` reports "No conversation found" and the conversation
 * is lost on a Done -> back round-trip. (Clearing `CLAUDECODE` alone, the prior
 * behavior, only stopped the child from refusing to start.) A Kangentic-spawned
 * agent must always be a clean top-level session, so drop every `CLAUDE_CODE_*`
 * marker except the keeplisted tuning flag below. This is the documented
 * practice for tools that spawn the Claude CLI as a subprocess; it is harmless
 * for non-Claude agents, which ignore these vars, and it deliberately leaves
 * `ANTHROPIC_*` keys (BYOK / API auth) untouched.
 *
 * A `null` value in `inputEnv` means DELETE the variable rather than set it,
 * which setting it to `''` does not achieve: the base of the merge is
 * `process.env`, so a variable exported by the shell that launched Kangentic is
 * inherited unless something actively removes it. An adapter that selects a
 * config directory needs "use the default" to mean the variable is absent, not
 * empty (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=''` resolves to the filesystem root, not `~`).
 *
 * `platform` is injectable for tests (cross-platform parity); production
 * callers omit it.
 */

/**
 * The one `CLAUDE_CODE_*` key that survives the strip, and its Windows
 * default. Unlike the identity markers above, this is a renderer tuning flag:
 * it cannot re-parent a child session. Claude Code's fullscreen TUI
 * intermittently omits history entries from its incremental scrolled-view
 * updates (deep scroll up, ride back down: entries vanish with the layout
 * closed up until a re-anchor - anthropics/claude-code#83714, confirmed
 * producer-side by diffing the raw PTY stream). Full-frame repaints remove
 * the incremental-update path entirely, and Claude Code's own agent views
 * enable this automatically on Windows. Defaulted on win32 only, matching
 * that practice; an explicit value already in the environment (including a
 * user's opt-out) always wins, and non-Claude agents ignore the var, the
 * same argument the strip itself relies on. PARTIAL mitigation: it removes
 * the dominant closed-up flavor, while the rarer blank-band flavor (a
 * window-assembly defect upstream) persists. Unwind this default once the
 * upstream issue is fixed.

 *  - cmd.exe cannot use a UNC path as its cwd (it prints
 *    "UNC paths are not supported" and defaults to C:\Windows). When
 *    we detect this, REPLACE the cwd with home and return a `pushd "<unc>"`
 *    fixup that the caller must write before the user command.
 *    PowerShell and Git Bash handle UNC cwds natively, so no fixup.
 *  - Windows PowerShell 5.1 (`powershell.exe`, the default Windows shell)
 *    treats `[` / `]` in its startup path as wildcard characters: launched
 *    with a valid Win32 cwd like `D:\[foo]\bar` its path provider fails to
 *    resolve the location and silently falls back to `$PSHOME`
 *    (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0`), so the agent CLI it
 *    spawns runs against the wrong workspace. node-pty's `cwd` is still a

 *    a `Set-Location -LiteralPath '<cwd>'` fixup that corrects the provider
 *    location. Applied to the whole PowerShell family (powershell + pwsh):
 *    the fixup is harmless in pwsh 7, and full shell paths make edition
