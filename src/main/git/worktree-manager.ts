 * multi-second under antivirus on a real install) off the per-project git queue.
 * Same-path races are excluded by the per-task `withTaskLock` the removal callers
 * (`deleteTaskWorktree`, `cleanupTaskResources`) already hold.
 *
 * Does NOT scan or kill processes: the orphaned-pinner reap is deferred to
 * `removeWorktree`'s failure path so a clean Done-move (the common case) pays no
 * process-scan cost. Idempotent (node_modules removal no-ops on ENOENT), so it
 * is correct to call this before the lock AND have `removeWorktree` call it again
 * inside each removal attempt. Never throws (removeNodeModulesPath swallows its
 * own errors). The junction guard in `removeNodeModulesPath` is load-bearing.
